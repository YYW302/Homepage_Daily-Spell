# Homepage/Start-up page: Daily Spell

This app shows a random spell from Harry Potter series, along with the automatic clock on the side. It also provides a Google search bar on the top, which makes it a good homepage / start-up page for your browsers (I did this as a Harry Potter fan :smiley:).

## Features

- A random spell shows everytime you refresh: help you to learn spells better
- Customised Google search bar: it still searches through Google, with a touch of _magic_ look
- Automatic clock: easy to check on the homepage
